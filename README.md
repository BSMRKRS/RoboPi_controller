## Welcome

I hope you enjoy working with the BSMRKRS Direct Robot Contol System. The DRCS only allows direct control of motors through a web interface with no autonomy.

# Driving a Robot

The server should start when you power up your BSMRKRS. Navigate to https://172.21.100.XX:8000/RoboPi_controller/commands/dashboard. Click on the web page to ensure that your computer is focused on the dashboard (so that key presses are captured correctly) and start driving! If this doesn't work, the most likely issue is that your computer is not on the same wireless network as your robot.

# Updating the Code on Your Robot

You can pull\* the latest version of this code onto your robot any time. SSH into your robot, enter the RoboPi_controller directory (at /home/student/web2py/applications/RoboPi_controller) and type `git pull origin master`.

It may complain that your local files are modified and it can't pull until you commit\* them. Often you can just delete these files -- common deletable files are `__init__.pyc` and `modules/__init__.pyc`; deleting these files is fine. If other files are getting in the way, take care (and maybe ask for help) when deleting them.

If you've modified files in the RoboPi_controller directory, pulling might overwrite your changes. If you're worried about this, checkout\* a new branch\* of your code before pulling from master, then you will have a access to your changes for sure.

\* The words 'pull', 'commit', and 'branch' are git terms. The web has a lot of advice about how to use git if you're curious.

# Modifying Your Local Code

SSH allows you to access one computer from another. You can SSH into your pi by opening a terminal on your laptop, joining the Robo network, and typing `ssh student@172.21.100.XX`. You'll then enter the password for the Student login.

Once you have a console open on your pi, you can access the files described below by entering the RoboPi_controller with the command `cd ~/web2py/applications/RoboPi_controller`.

The DRCS can be modified in 3 ways:

# Basic Usage

You can add or modify hard-coded outputs to motors in the existing button responses relatively easily. This process has two parts: 

1. If you want to use additional motor outputs, you'll need to initialize them in the Motor Establishment section. For example, if you want to add a new servo motor that runs on pin 5, you would add these lines of code to `/controllers/commands.py`:  

  ```
  motor_new = 4
  RPL.pinMode(motor_new,RPL.SERVO)
  ```

  Note that the pin labeled 5 on the RoboPi has to be called 4 in the code. Sigh. The pin labels are 1 indexed on the board, and 0 indexed in the code.

2. In `/controllers/commands.py`, under the section heading Individual Commands, you will find several blocks with this form:
  ```  
  def forward(dir):  
    if(dir=='go'):  
      xml_params = read_parameters_as_xml()   
      RPL.servoWrite(motorL,int(xml_params.get('motorL_forward')))  
      RPL.servoWrite(motorR,int(xml_params.get('motorR_forward')))  
    else:  
      RPL.servoWrite(motorL,0)  
      RPL.servoWrite(motorR,0)  
  ```  
  This is the code that runs when key assigned to 'forward' (i.e., w) is pressed or released. When w is pressed `forward('go')` is called, and when w is released `forward('stop')` is called. You can change what happens when w is pressed by changing the code under `if(dir=='go'):`. Suppose you want the servo attached to pin 5 to spin at a setting of 1200us when w is pressed, and at 1800us when w is released, you would change to code to look like this:  
  ```  
  def forward(dir):  
    if(dir=='go'):  
      xml_params = read_parameters_as_xml()   
      RPL.servoWrite(motorL,int(xml_params.get('motorL_forward')))  
      RPL.servoWrite(motorR,int(xml_params.get('motorR_forward')))  
      RPL.servoWrite(motor_new,1200))  
    else:  
      RPL.servoWrite(motorL,0)  
      RPL.servoWrite(motorR,0)  
      RPL.servoWrite(motor_new,1800))  
  ```  
  You'll have to manually change the 1200 and 1800 to get the motor to behave they way you want it to.  

# Intermediate Usage

You can add or modify outputs to motors that are adjustable on the web page, but still use the same button settings. This process has 5 parts.

1. Follow step 1 in the Basic Usage section.

2. You will need to add new form fields on the view page. In `/views/commands/dashboard.html` you will find a block of code that has several elements like this:  

  ```
    <p>L Motor Forward Setting</p>
    <input name="motorL_forward" value={{=motorL_forward}} />
  ```

  They all live between the `<form>` and `</form>` tag -- that's important. The text in the `<p>` section is the label, i.e., the text that shows above the input field. In the `<input>` tag, the text after `name=` -- in this case 'motorL_formard' -- is the name of the variable that will be stored, and can be accessed later by the motors. The variable after `value=` -- in this case {{=motorL_forward}} -- is value given to the web page (by `dashboard()` in `/controllers/commands.py`) that will show up in the input field when you view the page. Let's all agree to just give these the same name. You can add a new variable that will be accessible to the motors by duplicating these fields and setting the names. So we could add the following:  

  ```
    <p>New Motor Forward Setting</p>
    <input name="motor_new_forward" value={{=motor_new_forward}} />
  ```

  When we hit 'submit' on the dashboard, all of the values from these input fields are written to a file in web2py folder called `command_parameters.txt`.

  You will probably want to add a similar block for what the new motor should do when it runs backward.

3. The dashboard needs to have access to the variables that we have input forms for. The `dashboard()` function in `/controllers/commands.py` prepares information for the dashboard, so that's where this work is done.  

  The `/views/commands/dashboard.html` file has access to everything in the dictionary established in the line that looks something like this:  

  ```
    return dict(forward=URL('receive'),update_parameters=URL('update_parameters'),motorL_forward=xml_params.get('motorL_forward'),motorL_backward=xml_params.get('motorL_backward'),motorR_forward=xml_params.get('motorR_forward'),motorR_backward=xml_params.get('motorR_backward'))
  ```

  Each entry in that dictionary is a key=value pair separated by commas that can be called in `/views/commands/dashboard.html` like this: `{{=KEY_NAME}}`. The input fields will need to display the value stored in `command_parameters.txt`, so each key=value pair will look like `KEY_NAME=xml_params.get('VARIABLE_NAME')`. Like with step 2, let's just agree to name these the same things, so in this example, we'd add `,motor_new_forward=xml_params.get('motor_new_forward')` at the end of the list of entries in the dictionary. This will make `{{=motor_new_forward}}` return 2500 in `/views/commands/dashboard.html` and put that value in the correct input field.

4. Setting the motor outputs is similar to step 2 in the Basic Usage section. Instead of using numerical values, though, you can call the parameters you set in steps 1-3.  

  ```
  def forward(dir):
    if(dir=='go'):
      xml_params = read_parameters_as_xml()
      RPL.servoWrite(motorL,int(xml_params.get('motorL_forward')))
      RPL.servoWrite(motorR,int(xml_params.get('motorR_forward')))
      RPL.servoWrite(motor_new,int(xml_params.get('motor_new_forward')))
    else:
      RPL.servoWrite(motorL,0)
      RPL.servoWrite(motorR,0)
      RPL.servoWrite(motor_new,0)
  ```

  The `read_parameters_as_xml()` function loads all of the parameters from `command_parameters.txt` and the specific parameters can be called using the `.get()` command. If we set motor_new_forward in the dashboard using `name="motor_new_forward"` to 2500, then `int(xml_params.get('motor_new_forward'))` will return 2500.

5. Go to the web interface and set your new variables.  

# Advanced Usage

In the more advanced usage, you can set the functionality of new keyboard buttons. You'll do the following 3 steps, and then follow the steps for Intermediate Usage.

1. Any button you push while on the dashboard web page sends an AJAX command to the `receive` function in `/controllers/commands.py`. This function maps the key you press onto a function in the command_dictionary, defined at the very bottom of `/controllers/commands.py`. 

  If you want to add a new command to a button, you first have to add the character code of the key and the name of function you want to call when that key is pressed to the command_dictionary. Each entry has this form: `(CHARACTER_CODE,FUNCTION_NAME)` and the entries are all separated by commas. Suppose you want to add a command to pan a camera to the right when the k key is pressed. You would add something like this to the command_dictionary `(75,pan_right)`. 75 is the character code of the k key.

2. You then have to add the function that will be called when the key is pressed. We would probably add something like this:

  ```
  def pan_right(dir):
    if(dir=='go'):
      xml_params = read_parameters_as_xml()
      RPL.servoWrite(motor_pan,int(xml_params.get('pan_forward')))
    else:
      RPL.servoWrite(motor_pan,0)
  ```

  Notice that we call a variable called motor_pan, which is the pin identifier indicating where the pan servo is attached to the RoboPi; that would have to established as in the Basic Usage section. We also call the parameter pan_forward from the xml_params; that will have to be established like in the Intermediate Usage section.
